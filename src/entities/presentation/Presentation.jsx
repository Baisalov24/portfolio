          Hi, my name is Temirlan â€” a frontend developer focused on building production-ready, scalable web applications. I specialize in React with TypeScript and follow the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture to ensure clean, maintainable, and easily extensible code. I use Redux Toolkit & RTK Query for state and data management, and I containerize applications with Docker for consistent and reliable deployment. I prioritize performance optimization, DX/UX quality, and write code that is easy to support and scale. I actively collaborate with designers and backend engineers in Agile teams, delivering business-focused features efficiently and predictably.
